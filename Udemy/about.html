<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Im a Comedian whos always loved computers but never thought I would be able to
  learn programming, it maybe a lack of self esteem, but now i know i can learn
  programming. Ive been a stand up comedian and writer for three years, but
  comedy doesnt pay the bills until you have some time in the game. so in order
  to have some money and hookers ive choosen to learn coding. it was either that
  or a trade and trades dont pay enough to sustain my hooker addiction or my
  party lifestyle. I dont like having to think if i can afford something or not
  i want to be able to just buy it. Thats why ill become a great
  programmer/hacker,white hat hacker/ethical. I want to be making 300k off
  computing. In three years or less.

  Ive lived a wild and exciting life.My life just took a crazy true which
  aligned my priorities and showed me what really matters. it also most
  importantly, i think, showed me to leave the pass where it is behind me. the
  mind can be tricky and you have to avoid its old pictures. its like it takes
  pictures of you and the memory card becomes full, so when you go to look at
  pictures theyre all old and you dont see how different you are. so now i look
  at myself as a different person. I look at myself not as who ive been but who
  i want to be and who ill become. Life is about making yourself who you want to
  be not who youve been or who you think you are. Life is in your hands, theres
  no purpose in life but the one you give it.
